# Session Summary - January 28, 2026 (Session 2)

## What We Worked On
Updated the **sales-time skill** with a new email structure and added logic to prevent re-emailing contacts.

## Decisions Made
- **New email structure (NON-3PL):**
  1. Company incentive (public initiative: cost savings, sustainability, emissions, expansion)
  2. Question: "Are pallets part of that?"
  3. Expertise pitch: "Do you have someone with 10 years of pallet industry experience..."
  4. What I do: "Vet vendors, best pricing, manage coordination. Expertise without headcount."
  5. Closer: "15 minutes and you'll know whether to hire for this - or hand it off."

- **3PL opener uses Eric's pitch:** "I am you in the pallet space. I do for you what you're doing for your customers."

- **Removed the bridge line** ("Either way, they carry the supply chain") - if they don't use pallets, skip them entirely

- **Subject lines must reference public initiatives**, not just facility counts

- **Added follow-up exclusion logic:**
  - On email approval → set contact's `hs_lead_status` to "follow_up"
  - Pull filter excludes contacts where `hs_lead_status` = "follow_up"

- **Added to banned phrases:** "hoping to", "just wanted to", "worth the call"

## Current State
- `sales-time-skill.md` is updated and ready to load into Claude desktop
- Follow-up tracking is built into the workflow via `hs_lead_status`
- Examples tightened to under 95 words

## Open Loops
- Need to source contacts with emails for Tier B companies (many HubSpot contacts are international without US emails)
- May need to enrich contact data separately before running sales-time batches

## Files Changed/Created
- `sales-time-skill.md` - Complete rewrite with new email structure and follow-up logic

## Key Learnings
- **Lead with their public initiative** - cost savings targets, sustainability goals, emissions commitments. Facility count alone isn't enough.
- **The pitch is expertise, not pallets** - "You could hire someone with 10 years experience, or pay me a fraction and I disappear until you need me"
- **Decision frame closer** - "hire for this or hand it off" beats soft asks like "worth a call"
