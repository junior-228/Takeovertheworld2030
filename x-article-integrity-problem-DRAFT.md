## Section 1 - Opening [FINALIZED]

Every person who tries to sell you pallets will tell you the same thing. "We can beat that price" or "We'd never let that happen to you." Sometimes they say both in the same sentence.

But how would you even know that?

You don't. Not really anyways. Maybe you think back to the last time someone talked to you about pricing. How long ago was that? 30 days? 90? A year ago? "Who even is our pallet guy?" you may ask.

So you do what everyone else does. Give them a shot, file the email, add them to an RFP, or forward it to whoever you think handles pallets. Maybe procurement. Maybe ops. Maybe the person who dealt with it last time.

You're not the only one. For years, companies have procured pallets the same way as every other company. Same process. Same results.

There is a better way. But first, you need to understand why there's a problem to begin with.

Pallet pricing should be reviewed every 6 months. At minimum. Markets shift. Lumber costs move up and down. Vendors gain capacity, lose capacity, change what they can handle. A vendor who was competitive last year might not be today. A vendor who couldn't service you before might be able to now.

This isn't opinion. It's how the market works.

But who at your company is doing this? Who owns pallets?

Probably no one. It lives somewhere between procurement, ops, and facilities. Everyone touches it. No one owns it. So it doesn't get looked at until something breaks.

The companies who have someone - whether internal or external - who actually owns the pallet program? They catch the shifts. They keep vendors honest. They know what the market looks like, not just what one vendor told them.

If no one's talking to you about pricing, it's not because everything's fine. It's because no one's job depends on it.

And that's just the start. Before we get to the solution, you need to understand how this industry actually works - and why this matters whether you're buying pallets, selling cores, or both.

## Section 2 - Is This In Your Job Description? [FINALIZED]

**Pallet Program Manager**

**Responsibilities:**
- Determine optimal pallet strategy for the organization (new, recycled, rental, owned)
- Evaluate pallet specs (GMA, block, custom) based on product requirements, racking systems, and facility needs
- Benchmark pricing by volume, location, and market conditions
- Monitor lumber pricing trends and advise on when to lock in rates
- Vet and manage vendor relationships across all regions
- Identify vendors at capacity risk before it affects supply
- Track cost per pallet by location, vendor performance, and on-time delivery rates
- Aggregate purchasing power across facilities to maximize leverage
- Conduct pricing reviews every 6 months minimum
- Resolve supply issues same-day with backup vendors ready

**Requirements:**
- Deep knowledge of the pallet industry and regional supplier landscape
- Years of vendor relationships and market experience
- Ability to tell which vendors are reliable and which ones are full of shit

Sound familiar?

Probably not. This role doesn't exist at most companies.

But it should.

This is what it looks like when pallets are actually managed. When someone owns the vendor relationships. Knows the market. Reviews pricing before you have to ask. Solves problems before they reach your desk.

No more RFP cycles that lead back to the same place. No more finding out about a delay after it's already a fire. No more wondering if you're overpaying because no one's looked at it in two years.

Instead, pallets end up on someone's plate. And their job is to run an RFP, or go with whoever gave them the best pricing. Then move on to the 15 other things they were actually hired to do.

And if the last vendor was so great, why are you out for bid again?

Maybe it's company policy. Maybe the contract is up. Or maybe things didn't go the way they were supposed to, and now you're back at square one.

Same process. Same vendors. Same results.

There aren't many people who understand this game. And the ones who do? They're usually not looking for a job managing your pallet program.

So that leaves most companies with two choices. Go with a national provider. Or go with a local yard.

## Section 3 - National or Local. Pick Your Problem. [DRAFT - Subsections need Rob's review]

Neither option is perfect. There are a few key differences, but it really depends on the goal your company is trying to achieve.

Some have found a third option. But we'll get to that.

These two choices are why most companies stay stuck in the same cycle. Same RFP. Same vendors. Same problems. Year after year.

Here's why.

### Local Yards

Local yards are exactly what they sound like. A pallet company near your facility. They make pallets, recycle pallets, or both. You call them, they deliver.

The pros? Pricing is usually better. Less overhead. Less bureaucracy. You're not paying for a national sales team, corporate offices, or layers of management. Just pallets.

You know who you're dealing with. The owner might answer the phone. Problems get solved fast because there's no chain of command. They need your business, and they act like it.

The cons? They can only service what's near them. If you've got 20 facilities across 10 states, a local yard can maybe handle one or two. Now you're managing 10 different vendors. 10 different contacts. 10 different invoices. 10 different relationships.

And if one of them fails? You're scrambling. There's no backup plan. No network to pull from. Just you, making calls, trying to find someone who can show up tomorrow.

Local yards also get left out of RFPs. If you're a national company looking for one vendor to handle everything, they're not even invited. They can't service all your locations, so they don't make the list. Doesn't matter if their pricing is better. They never got a chance to show you.

### National Providers

National providers can service all your locations. One contract. One invoice. One vendor to manage. That's the pitch, anyway.

The reality is more complicated.

Here's how most national pallet companies actually work. They have plants - facilities they own and operate. And they have a brokerage team - people who source from local yards where they don't have plants.

When you send them an RFP, both teams bid. The plant bids on facilities near them. The brokerage team bids on everything else. A pricing manager looks at both and picks the winner. You get one quote.

You're not comparing different vendors. You're comparing one company's internal options.

And here's the part no one tells you: the brokerage team often funnels volume to specific yards to get competitive rates. That pricing you got? It's tied to that one vendor performing. If they fail, your pricing fails with them.

The other problem? Scale comes with layers.

Sales sold you. But sales isn't delivering your pallets. That's ops. And when something goes wrong, it's not ops who calls you back - it's customer service. Or your account manager. Or someone you've never talked to.

National gives you scale. But when something breaks, 5 people need to know about your problem before anyone solves it.
