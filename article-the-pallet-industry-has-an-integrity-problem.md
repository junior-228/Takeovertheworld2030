# The Pallet Industry Has an Integrity Problem

No one has the incentive to tell you the truth.

Your vendor's job is to keep your business. Not to tell you the market shifted and you're overpaying. Not to tell you there's a better vendor for your specs. Not to tell you their capacity is stretched and your orders are at risk.

Saying those things could cost them the account. So they don't. And you don't know what you don't know.

---

Every person who tries to sell you pallets will tell you the same thing.

"We can beat that price" or "We'd never let that happen to you." Sometimes they say both in the same sentence.

But how would you even know that?

You don't. Not really. Maybe you think back to the last time someone talked to you about pricing. How long ago was that? 30 days? 90? A year ago?

"Who even is our pallet guy?"

So you do what everyone else does. Give them a shot, file the email, add them to an RFP, or forward it to whoever you think handles pallets. Maybe procurement. Maybe ops. Maybe the person who dealt with it last time.

Same process. Same results.

---

There is a better way. But it doesn't start with a better vendor.

It starts with understanding why the problem exists in the first place - and why more options won't fix it.

---

And that process usually looks like one of two things.

You run an RFP. You gather your site details - locations, volumes, specs, consumption patterns. You send it out to your list of suppliers.

Now here's what happens on the other side.

Every vendor who receives that RFP is doing the same math. They're looking at the volume. They're looking at the locations. And they're figuring out the lowest number they can put on paper and still make it work.

The goal of an RFP is to get the best price. That makes sense. But that goal is exactly why this becomes a race to the bottom. Every vendor is solving for the same thing - a number that wins. Not a number that's right. Only a number that will win.

So the proposals come back. The pricing is usually within a few percent of each other. You pick the lowest one - or the one that feels most reliable - sign for 12 months, and move on.

You locked in a snapshot of a market that doesn't sit still.

And for the next 12 months? Surprise rate increases. Quality drops. Deliveries keep getting missed. You're locked in, so you deal with it.

Then the contract is up. And you do it again.

---

Or you skip that process entirely.

Maybe you don't need an RFP. Maybe your sites handle it themselves. Suppliers and brokers are calling, pitching their price. Cheaper than your current guy? Now you have a choice to make.

Reducing expenses is a must. But at what cost?

---

The underlying problem with both of these methods is that they can do more harm than good. You just don't see it right away.

Both approaches treat pallets like a transaction. Get the best price. Get them to the dock. Move on.

---

The transaction gets handled. But between transactions is where the details live.

Who's watching for them?

Procurement? They ran the RFP. They got the price. They moved on.

Operations? They request deliveries. They receive deliveries. That's where it starts and stops.

Facilities? They'll let you know if pallets are stacked where they shouldn't be.

So who actually owns pallets?

The person selling them to you?

---

Probably no one. And that's the problem.

So it doesn't get looked at until something breaks.

---

Does this sound familiar?

Rejected load. Inaccurate ETA. Production can't load. Line backs up. Team standing around. Phone calls and emails start flying.

And for what?

To find another vendor who can show up today. Not the best vendor. Not the cheapest. Just whoever answers the phone and has a truck.

Nobody's comparing prices. Nobody's checking specs. You just need pallets at the dock and you need them now.

Meanwhile, nothing's moving.

And when the dust settles, nobody logs what it actually cost. The downtime. The scramble. The hours spent on the phone instead of doing the job they were actually hired to do. It just gets absorbed.

And next week it happens again at a different facility.

That's not bad luck. That's what happens when something is treated like a commodity instead of a program.

---

The companies who have someone - whether internal or external - who actually owns the pallet program? They catch the shifts before they become fires. They know what the market looks like, not just what one vendor told them.

If no one's proactively talking to you about your pallet program, it's not because everything's fine. It's because no one's job depends on it.

Sound familiar?

Probably not. This role doesn't exist at most companies. But it should.

---

**This is what it looks like when pallets are actually managed.**

When someone owns the vendor relationships. Knows the market. Reviews pricing before you have to ask. Solves problems before they reach your desk.

No more RFP cycles that lead back to the same place. No more finding out about a delay after it's already a fire. No more wondering if you're overpaying because no one's brought it up.

---

**Instead, here's what actually happens.**

Pallets end up on someone's plate. Their job is to run an RFP, or go with whoever gave them the best pricing. Then move on to the 15 other things they were actually hired to do.

And if the last vendor was so great, why are you out for bid again?

Maybe it's company policy. Maybe the contract is up. Or maybe things didn't go the way they were supposed to, and now you're back at square one.

Same process. Same faces. Same results.

There aren't many people who understand this game. And the ones who do? They're usually not looking for a job managing your pallet program.

So that leaves most companies with two choices. Go with a national provider. Or go with a local yard.

---

## National or Local. Pick Your Problem.

Neither option is perfect. There are a few key differences, but it really depends on the goal your company is trying to achieve.

Some have found a third option. More on that later.

These two choices are why most companies stay stuck in the same cycle. Same RFP results. Same faces. Same problems. Year after year.

---

### Local Yards

There's a lot to like.

They're the ones doing the work. Usually family owned and operated, or they've been around long enough that they've probably serviced your facility before - directly or indirectly. You can call the owner and your problem gets taken care of right away.

They'll have competitive rates. Great service. And they'll go to the ends of the earth to make sure you have what you need.

But.

Most only have one location. Maybe two. So geographically, they can only cover so much. If you have facilities in three states, you need three vendors. Five states, five vendors. And now you're back to managing multiple relationships, multiple invoices, multiple phone calls when something goes wrong.

None of this makes them bad. Most local yards are great at what they do. Their limitation isn't about effort. It's their reach.

---

### National Providers

The other end of the spectrum.

They have the footprint. Locations everywhere. A sales team, an account manager, a customer service line. They can cover all your facilities from one contract. One invoice. One point of contact.

On paper, that solves everything the local yard can't.

But.

You're not their only customer. You're not their biggest customer. And the person who sold you isn't the person servicing you.

The sales rep who promised the world? They're onto the next deal.

Now you're talking to an account manager. They know your specs. They know your pricing. But they also know the specs and pricing of 50 other accounts. Your business matters - but so does everyone else's.

The people actually making sure your orders happen? That's the operations team. They're coordinating vendors, scheduling deliveries, managing capacity. But they're not dedicated to you. They're running the same process for every account in their region. Your order is one of dozens moving through the same system on the same day.

And if there's a customer service team? They're fielding calls from everyone. They know your name, not your business.

So your account manager manages relationships. Operations manages orders. Customer service manages problems. But nobody manages your pallet program.

And they can't. Not really. They're the ones selling to you. A vendor can't optimize your program when their revenue depends on what you're spending. That's not a knock on them - it's just the structure. The incentive doesn't line up.

They can sell you pallets. They can service your account. But managing your program means sometimes telling you to spend less, switch vendors, or change specs. That's not a conversation a vendor is built to have.

None of this is bad. It's how companies get their pallets. And when you have 5, 10, 15, 100 locations, it's the only viable option. Nobody wants local vendors across every region sending in different invoices, different paperwork, different processes.

So you go national. You trade the relationship for the reach. And it works. Until it doesn't.

---

## The Third Option

What if the solution isn't a better vendor, better metrics, or a new dashboard?

What if it's someone whose only job is to manage your pallets? Anyone can sell you one.

That's what a pallet 3PL does.

Same concept as a logistics 3PL. You don't own your own trucks. Some of you don't manage your own warehouse. You hire someone who's an expert in that field. That way, you can focus on the things that actually need your attention.

A pallet 3PL works the same way.

Go back to that job description. Now imagine that person works for you.

When's the last time you had to chase down a pallet vendor? That doesn't happen anymore.

When's the last time you found out about a supply issue after it was already a fire? That doesn't happen anymore.

When's the last time you ran an RFP and ended up right back where you started? That doesn't happen anymore.

When's the last time someone told you - without you asking - that the market shifted and here's what it means for your pricing? That happens now.

When's the last time a new facility came online and pallets were just... handled? That happens now.

When's the last time you didn't think about pallets at all? That's the point.

---

The pallet industry doesn't have a quality problem. It has an integrity problem.

Not because people are bad at their jobs. Because no one's job is to align with your incentives.

Local yards will take care of you - within their reach. National providers will cover your footprint - within their structure. But neither one is built to manage your program. They're built to sell you pallets.

The companies that figure this out don't switch vendors. They change the structure.

And the ones that don't? Same process. Same faces. Same results.

Only you know which one you're in.
